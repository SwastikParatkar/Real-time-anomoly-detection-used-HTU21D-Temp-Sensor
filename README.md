# Real-time-anomoly-detection-used-HTU21D-Temp-Sensor
A real-time anomaly detection system using the HTU21D sensor continuously monitors temperature and humidity data to identify abnormal environmental conditions using AI/ML models. It helps detect unexpected changes for applications like smart homes or industrial monitoring this project impliment by STM32 Nucleo Board
